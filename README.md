# Rails + Angular Ready.App

**Barebones _Rails_ application with _AngularJS_ built into the _Asset Pipeline_**

### Currently only one way to get started

<tt>git clone https://github.com/learric/Angular.Rails</tt>

<tt>mv Angular.Rails _YOUR-APP-NAME_</tt>

<tt>cd YOUR-APP-NAME</tt>

<tt>rails s</tt>

Then open a web browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). If there is a form field inside of a green box, begin entering your name. If 'Hello, YOUR-NAME' appears in green, _CONGRATS!_, everything downloaded correctly.

Next, open app/assets/javascripts/home.coffee, app/views/index.html.erb, and config/application.rb and change **_AppName_** to whatever your app is named. Try [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) again to make sure the changes worked.
